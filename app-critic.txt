Critic of Cracked.com App

The thumbnails on the article page of the app are different sizes, and it is confusing to look at.

The buttons to seel all articles, videos, etc. are small and it is easy to press the wrong button.

Also the style these buttons are in is not aesthetically pleasing.

Photoshop contest pictures are in slideshow format which can mess up how the pictures are displayed on the screen.

It would also just be easier to navigate if the slideshow was displayed on one page.

Video selection page has very large thumbnails that take a while to load as you browse.

No way to easily navigate between articles placed in the thumbnail across the top on the home page. 

You have to scroll all the way to the top of the article to be prompted with the button that brings you back to previous articles.

Text is small to read considering the length of the articles presented.

It is not clear what the icons on the bottom tool bar actually do.
